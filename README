Beep Music v 1.00 by Narzew Readme

Hello! Thanks for downloading BeepMusic! In this text file I will tell you the base use of the program.
Operating system requirements:

- Linux with instaled Ruby and beep software.

1) Playing Beep Music

To play music you run the program with the argument play and the path to music file in .cbm format. Examples are located in the Music directory.

Examples includes:
Quick.cbm - quick music for example
Test200.cbm - quick test with 200-280 freqencies
Iterate.cbm - big beep music that iterates on all available frequencies

2) Making Beep Music

Firstly you must create your music .bpm file.
The structure is: (header)

BPM
name Name Of The Music
author Author Of The Music
desc Description Of The Music
enname English Name Of The Music
endesc English Description Of The Music

Below header there are frequencies list. Structure is:

name freq [Frequency] [Length] [Delay] [Repeats], for example:

test freq 200 100 20 1

endfreq string ends the frequency section.

Below frequency section there are frequency list.
Struct is : frequencyname^repeats for example:

test^7

Now you must compile created .bpm file to playable .cbm format. Run the program with arguments compile and path to input bpm and output cbm.

Compiled .cbm files can be played with Beep Music. You can share it in the internet ;)

3) Making advanced Beep Music

3.1) Mixing frequencies

You can mix 2 or 3 frequencies:

freq1^freq2^6 (freq1 mixed with freq2 with 6 repeats)
freq1^freq2^freq3^8 (freq1 mixed with freq2 mixed with freq3 with 8 repeats)

3.2) You can make range frequences:

test change [Start Freq] [End Freq] [Length] [Delay] [Repeats] for example:
test change 100 200 20 10 1 # Frequencies 100->200
test change 200 100 20 10 1 # Frequencies 200->100 (reversed previous example)

That's all!

Enjoy!
